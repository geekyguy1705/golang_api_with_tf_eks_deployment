Tiny App Development: 'SimpleTimeService'
Create a simple microservice (which we will call "SimpleTimeService") in any programming language of your choice: Go, NodeJS, Python, C#, Ruby, whatever you like.
The application should be a web server that returns a pure JSON response with the following structure, when its / URL path is accessed:
{
  "timestamp": "<current date and time>",
  "ip": "<the IP address of the visitor>"
}
